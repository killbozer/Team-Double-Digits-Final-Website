    <h1>Absentee Policy</h1>
    <div class="content-block-1">
      <p>All students are expected to attend normal school hours every school day of each term. It is important that children develop habits of regular attendance at an early age.</p>
      <p>School attendance helps children develop social skills, such as friendship building, teamwork, communication skills and healthy self-esteem. Students who regularly miss school are at risk of
         missing out on learning the basic building blocks of each subject and may experience long term difficulties with their learning.</p>

      <h2>What to do if Your Child is Late</h2>
      <p>If your child will be late to school or absent, we ask that you contact the school before classes begin for the day on 89321700 or via email <a href="mailto:admin.graysch@ntschools.net">admin.graysch@ntschools.net</a></p>
      <p>If you do not make contact with the school prior to morning roll call, your child will be marked as ‘Un-notified’.</p>
      <p>Children who are regularly late to school miss out on some very important morning procedures and often do not feel part of
         activities. It can be disruptive to class and punctuality is a valued asset in our community.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content-block-3">
      <h2>Star Attendee</h2>
      <p>If your child’s attendance is 95% or more. They are likely to be a “Star Performer” due to their excellent attendance. They will almost certainly achieve the best grades for their ability
         and have real opportunity in further education and the world of work. They have the opportunity to make and keep friends.</p>

      <h2>You are Almost There!</h2>
      <p>If your child’s attendance is between 85 and 95%. They are on “Green for Go” for good attendance. They
         have a great chance of reaching their potential in education and the world of work. They have the opportunity to make and keep friends.</p>

      <h2>Caution!</h2>
      <p>If your child’s attendance is between 80% and 85%. They are on “Amber for Caution”. They are missing so many days of school each year that
         it might be difficult for them to achieve their best. They will have difficulty making and keeping friends.</p>

      <h2>Danger!</h2>
      <p>If your child’s attendance is below 80%. Immediate action by parent is required. They are missing so much time from school that it will be almost impossible for them to keep in touch with
        their lessons. They will quickly fall behind their year level unless their attendance improves. They will have difficulty making and keeping friends.</p>
